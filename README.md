### Project Python Foundations: FoodHub Data Analysis

#### Context:
As the restaurant scene in New York grows, FoodHub, a food aggregator, serves busy individuals and students seeking convenient dining options. Through its app, FoodHub grants access to numerous eateries, streamlining the ordering process.

#### Process:
Restaurants receive direct online orders via the app, and FoodHub arranges delivery personnel to collect confirmed orders. Once picked up, delivery personnel use GPS to navigate to the restaurant, collect the food package, and deliver it to the customer. Customers can rate orders, and FoodHub earns revenue through fixed delivery margin.

#### Objetive ABC Analysis:
A. Analyze order frequency per restaurant to identify top performers and areas for improvement.
B. Examine order costs per restaurant to understand profitability and develop strategies for cost optimization.
